# Contributing

Use Node 24+ (or Node 22.13+), Chromium, ffmpeg and ffprobe. Run `npm ci` to install development dependencies. `install.sh` installs a published release separately from the checkout; it does not prepare development dependencies.

## Checks

```bash
npm test
npm run test:install
npm run test:cli
npm run test:app
npm run test:custom-themes
npm run test:animations
npm run test:canvas-effects
npm run test:intro
npm run test:visual
npm run test:integration
npm run test:experimental
```

Unit tests cover options, themes, assets, geometry, fonts, synchronization, request security, output safety and resource cleanup. Browser suites exercise deterministic frames, all website effects, theme imports, playback, real exports and cancellation. The installer suite uses isolated user directories, not your desktop configuration.

Inside a graphical Omarchy session, `npm run test:app-window` opens and closes a test app window. Add `-- --sighup` to test terminal-hangup cleanup. Other tests do not need an interactive desktop.

Visual baselines are Chromium/environment-specific. Use `npm run test:visual -- --update` only after inspecting the change. Never update baselines just to hide a failure. Generated reports, screenshots, videos and caches stay out of Git.

## Releases

Set a stable version in `package.json` and the lockfile, run tests and the public-file audit, then commit and tag that commit `vX.Y.Z`. `npm run build:release` archives committed files only and produces the source archive, standalone `installer.mjs` and `SHA256SUMS` under `.cache/releases/vX.Y.Z/`. Upload all three files to a draft GitHub release on the matching tag, then publish it after checking the assets. Never replace the assets of a published version; publish a new version instead.

The bootstrap fetches the latest release installer. The installer resolves a version once and downloads the archive and checksum from that version's release. Updates use per-user locking, private staging, a package-identity check, locked production dependencies without lifecycle scripts, a CLI startup check, and an atomic active-version link. Checksums provide integrity, not an independent signature or a defense against compromised upstream accounts/dependencies. Updates run the currently installed manager; rerunning the bootstrap obtains the latest installer when manager fixes are needed. Previous release directories are deliberately retained, not automatically pruned, because a process may still be using an older version.

Development tests isolate runtime data with `BILLBOARD_DATA_DIR` and `BILLBOARD_CACHE_DIR`. Set `BILLBOARD_TEST_TMPDIR` to a short writable directory if the checkout path exceeds Chromium's socket limits.

## Code quality

`npm run lint` enforces ESLint classic cyclomatic complexity of 6 per function across maintained application code, CLI entry points and scripts. `npm run complexity` prints the inventory. Tests and bundled third-party runtime code are excluded. Inline suppression cannot bypass the guard.

Three preserved campaign algorithms have exact named caps:

| File | Function | Cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web/glyph-piles.js` | `createGlyphPiles` | 18 |
| `web/independent-sparks.js` | `createIndependentSparks` | 14 |
| `web/independent-sparks.js` | `drawGlyph` | 7 |

New functions in those files still have the default limit. Preserve official logo geometry, independent simulations, native effect colors, irregular ember appearance and the single-canvas output contract.

Use English for documentation, diagnostics and comments. Generated copy uses the selected locale. Do not introduce private paths, credentials, internal work notes or runtime dependencies on another checkout. Keep third-party credits and licenses intact.

## Release hygiene

Run `npm run audit:public` after staging changes. It checks every staged path and blob for private documents, generated artifacts, credentials and personal filesystem paths, including diagnostic strings in binary assets. Review the staged diff and dependency changes as well. Automated scans reduce risk but are not a guarantee that arbitrary secrets can be detected.

Publish only reviewed source files and required licensed/permitted assets. Syncing newer upstream data is separate from updating executable runtime assets; document source revisions, hashes and modifications in the provenance manifests.
